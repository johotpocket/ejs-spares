#### EJS Bears

#### Description
we are going to build an application which uses EJS to render different pages. The pages will be displaying 'bears'.
For example:

UI Routes:
/ => Home route, renders index.ejs
/viewBears => This will render an EJS page that displays all bears.
/post => This will render a form, capable of creating a new bear.
